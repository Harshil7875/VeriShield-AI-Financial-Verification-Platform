# VeriShield: AI-Powered Financial Identity Verification

VeriShield is an **open-source initiative** to build a **modular, scalable**, and **efficient** backend solution for **KYC (Know Your Customer)** and **KYB (Know Your Business)** processes. Leveraging technologies such as **FastAPI**, **PostgreSQL**, **Neo4j**, **Kafka**, and **Machine Learning**, the project automates identity verification, detects fraud, and provides risk scores—all while remaining flexible for community-driven enhancements.

## Introduction

VeriShield serves as a **backend simulation** for financial institutions, fintech startups, and e-commerce platforms seeking to streamline **KYC/KYB** processes. By automating verification, fraud detection, and risk scoring, it addresses complex identity management challenges in highly regulated sectors, providing:

- **Automated identity verification** to reduce manual checks and human error.  
- **Fraud detection** via advanced machine learning models.  
- **Real-time risk assessment** with event-driven architecture (Kafka).  
- **Graph-based analysis** (Neo4j) for revealing hidden relationships and suspicious patterns.

Ultimately, **VeriShield** forms a foundation for **community contributions** to drive innovation in identity verification and compliance.

## Project Goals

### Core Objectives

1. **Automate KYC/KYB** checks by validating user and business identities.  
2. **Detect anomalies and potential fraud** using machine learning.  
3. **Model and query entity relationships** in a graph database for advanced fraud detection.  
4. **Handle asynchronous workflows** with high reliability using **Kafka**.  
5. **Enable scalability** through containerization, microservices, and cloud readiness.

### Targeted Real-World Applications

- **Fintech**: Complying with AML (Anti-Money Laundering) rules, automating user identity checks for online banking, payments, etc.  
- **Digital Banking & E-Commerce**: Reducing fraudulent transactions in high-volume platforms.  
- **Fraud Detection**: Leveraging ML to detect suspicious patterns and preemptively flag high-risk activities.

---

## Features (Phase 1)

- **Dockerized Setup**: Quickly launch **FastAPI**, **PostgreSQL**, and **Neo4j** for local development.  
- **Basic Endpoint**: A `/health` route to confirm the service status.  
- **Initial Testing**: Simple Pytest coverage to ensure the environment is functional.  
- **Foundational Structure**: Clear directory layout, `.gitignore`, `.dockerignore`, and environment variables support.

---

## Quick Start

1. **Clone the Repo**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-org/VeriShield.git
   cd VeriShield
   ```

2. **Run Docker Compose**  
   ```bash
   docker compose up --build -d
   ```
   - Spins up **PostgreSQL** (port 5432), **Neo4j** (ports 7474 & 7687), and the **FastAPI** service (port 8000).

3. **Check the Health Endpoint**  
   - Navigate to [http://localhost:8000/health](http://localhost:8000/health).  
   - Expected response: `{"status": "OK"}`

---

## Requirements

- **Docker Desktop** (or Docker Engine + `docker compose`)  
- **Python 3.11+** (if running tests locally without Docker)  
- **Git** for version control  
- *(Optional)* **Conda/virtualenv** for local Python environment isolation  

> **Apple Silicon Users**: Ensure images support `arm64` or set `platform: linux/amd64` in `docker-compose.yml` where needed.

---

## Testing

- **With Docker**  
  ```bash
  docker compose run backend pytest --maxfail=1 --disable-warnings -v
  ```

- **Locally**  
  ```bash
  # Install dependencies:
  cd backend
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  
  # Run tests:
  cd ..
  python -m pytest backend/tests --maxfail=1 --disable-warnings -v
  ```
